# Liver-Disease-Prediction-using-Classifiers


Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:
1.	Model Development: Create a robust predictive model that accurately assesses the risk of liver diseases in individuals based on a diverse set of attributes.
2.	Dataset Analysis: Analyze a representative dataset from the Indian population, considering demographic, lifestyle, and clinical data to enhance the model's accuracy and applicability.
3.	Interpretability and Transparency: Prioritize the development of a model that is not only accurate but also interpretable, enabling healthcare professionals to understand and trust its predictions.
4.	Contribution to Public Health: Contribute valuable insights to the field of preventive healthcare in India by providing a tool that can aid in early identification and intervention for liver diseases.


Dataset Overview:
The dataset appears to contain information related to liver health, with various attributes measured for each individual. Below is a detailed explanation of each column:
1.	Age:
•	Definition: The age of the individual.
•	Example: The first row indicates an individual aged 65.
2.	Gender:
•	Definition: The gender of the individual.
•	Example: The second row indicates a male individual.

3.	Total_Bilirubin:
•	Definition: Total bilirubin level in the blood (measured in mg/dL).
•	Example: The third row indicates a total bilirubin level of 7.3 mg/dL.
4.	Direct_Bilirubin:
•	Definition: Direct bilirubin level in the blood (measured in mg/dL).
•	Example: The third row indicates a direct bilirubin level of 4.1 mg/dL.
5.	Alkaline_Phosphotase:
•	Definition: Alkaline phosphatase enzyme level (measured in IU/L).
•	Example: The third row indicates an alkaline phosphatase level of 490 IU/L.
6.	Alamine_Aminotransferase:
•	Definition: Alamine aminotransferase (ALT) enzyme level (measured in IU/L).
•	Example: The third row indicates an ALT level of 60 IU/L.
7.	Aspartate_Aminotransferase:
•	Definition: Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) enzyme level (measured in IU/L).
•	Example: The third row indicates an AST level of 68 IU/L.
8.	Total_Protiens:
•	Definition: Total proteins in the blood (measured in g/dL).
•	Example: The third row indicates a total proteins level of 7.0 g/dL.
9.	Albumin:
•	Definition: Albumin level in the blood (measured in g/dL).
•	Example: The third row indicates an albumin level of 3.3 g/dL.
10.	Albumin_and_Globulin_Ratio:
•	Definition: Ratio of albumin to globulin in the blood.
•	Example: The third row indicates a ratio of 0.89.
11.	Dataset:
•	Definition: The target variable indicating whether the individual has liver disease (1) or not (2).
•	Example: The third row indicates that the individual has liver disease (Dataset value of 1).




Conclusion
In this project, we undertook an in-depth analysis of liver disease prediction using a diverse set of classifiers. The dataset, encompassing various demographic and clinical attributes, allowed us to explore the capabilities of different algorithms in predicting the presence or absence of liver disease.
